Getting through this section has been super challenging because it's felt extremely time consuming. My biggest struggle were lessons that tried to teach the background of how to do something, asked me to code along, but first showed the long way (and wrong way) first and made me refactor because it wasn't the correct way to do it. That style drove me crazy and was extremely frustrating. I would just like to know the correct way up front and maybe then learn how to deconstruct it or then learn why the short way works the way it should. 

I created a movie review application for my final project and felt like it was much easier than all the rest of the labs so far because I didn't have to deal with Capybara tests trying to ruin my life. Rails was very helpful in letting me know if I made a mistake so I was able to debug pretty quickly. The toughest part was getting the oauth with Google to work. I saved this for last luckily so it wouldn't bog me down with building everything out. 

Overall, I learned that I actually learned more than I thought I did about how to create an app using Rails.
