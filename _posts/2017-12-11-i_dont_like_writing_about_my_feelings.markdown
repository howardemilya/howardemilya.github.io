So this is my first ever (*mandatory*) blog post. I've been putting this off because I hate writing in general (I was always better at the math and foreign language classes, where I don't have to express my opinion or elaborate on what I mean by anything). I used to joke that if our teachers in college were to give us the option of writing a paper or having a tooth pulled, that I'd have no teeth left (I really hate it that much). 

You might think that coding is like writing - but to me it's not. It's more like a puzzle I get to put together to make something work (and I'm good at puzzles!).  I used to feel the same about my foreign languages classes too - they were always my favorite. And I suppose that's what I'm doing currently - learning a new language. So I will be writing (*sigh*) about the process and what it's been like to go through learning via the Flatiron School platform. 

But that's all I've got for today...
