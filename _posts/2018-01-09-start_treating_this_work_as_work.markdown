So far I've taken twice as long to get through this program as I thought it would take and I'm not even finished with Sinatra yet. It can be a little overwhelming especially financially (despite having the Women Take Tech Scholarship). I took several steps back from my career in sales, making good money but not being satisfied with my job. Going from great income to returning to the food and beverage world - that's been tough.

I did the food and bev thing before in my early twenties when it was fun to be broke and drink all the time. Now that I'm not interested in any of that, I find each day at my "job" more and more demoralizing. I know it's all a means of getting to the end goal - getting that better job with a great schedule in the tech world. I know I'm getting there, I know I'm competent, and if I just keep plugging along, I'll get there. But right now, it feels far out of reach and this server budget is just not sustainable much longer. 

It's tough to stay focused, buckle down, put enough time in - and I know I sound like I'm complaining when really, I want for nothing. It's completely #firstworldproblems but I'm tired. Where is the light at the end of the tunnel? I'm so fortunate I have such a supportive partner in this life who helps me get by but I think even he is tired of being the only one with the money, and even he is tired of me "just getting by"... 

I've decided I can't treat this school like homework from college or high school where you can just breeze through it with 10,000 destractions going on around - what I need to do is start treating this like an actual job (like I'm at work). Are you allowed to check your phone ten times a minute at work? NO.  Turn it off! Oh can you, just real quick, take the dog out and pick up my dry cleaning and call the vet and clean the dishes and do the laundry and pick up the groceries while you're at work? Absolutely not. Work needs to be a bubble of focus and block of time without destractions. 

New schedule. Blocked out time of real and focused work. No more messing around. I'm ready to get out of this restaurant business bull crap nowwww. Starting today, I'm scheduling my school work. Not just a little here, a little there, while I'm watching the game... it's going to be a work shift. Hours long block, no distractions, maybe even out of the house. I'm always up for a good Starbucks :)
