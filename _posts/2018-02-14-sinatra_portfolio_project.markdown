Finally done with my Sinatra Project and wow it took longer than expected! Not really the project itself - but the labs leading up to the project. There were three tedious and time consuming labs that were just horrible to get through purely because of the way the tests were set up. Once I got to my portfolio project and the BROWSER was the test - phew! That was easy peasy! 

It was challenging coming up with an idea so I made a "secret family recipe book" application so people could keep their recipes private with having an account.  I'm anxious to get through my assessment so I can keep going! Seems like the past week really got away from me. Hopefully I'll be able to pick up some momentum in this next section on Rails!
