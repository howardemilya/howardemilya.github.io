Getting started was the hardest part. For some reason this whole project sounded incredibly overwhelming at first. I didn't want to do it even though I knew I had the tools to get it done. 

Picking the website was challenging at first until my boyfriend and I got into the age-old back and forth (again) of *where do you want to go for dinner?*

After spending a few years in the restaurant industry myself, I chose to take a look at Eater's website because it's the one source I trust the most when it comes to where I should go to eat (they have never steered me wrong!).

Once I had looked over the website and figured out how I was going to organize my app, things got much easier and I got into a flow where I could not put the computer away! *Just five more minutes, I just want to build out this one more method...* flash to: 2 AM *still working.*

Besides picking the overall concept/website, I would say the most challenging part for me was figuring out those object relationships. I knew from the beginning that my cities would *have many* restaurants and that a restaurant would *belong to* a city. I also knew how those relationships were supposed to work but actually writing the code so that when you create a new object from data (from the scraped websites) it creates the relationship too, that took me a little bit to get it right.

Overall, I think I learned a lot from it and probably shouldn't have skipped it a couple months ago like I did (I was just stuck and didn't want to waste time dwelling on it so I just needed to start something different to get back into my groove! - mission accomplished) but I also think stepping back for a little while and moving into SQL and ActiveRecord helped gain a little perspective. 

Next post: video walkthrough.
